# Supplementary Visualizations for Our TAES Paper

This repository hosts **supplementary trajectory visualizations** (GIF/PNG) accompanying our paper on long-horizon stratospheric airship trajectory planning under forecast-uncertain wind fields.

> **Paper:** *Trajectory Planning for Stratospheric Airship under Forecast-Uncertain Wind Fields via Asymmetric Actor-Critic Reinforcement Learning*. 
> **Method:** *[POMDP + Asymmetric Actor–Critic + LSTM]*
> **Framework:** ![Framework](asset/framework.png)

## What’s Inside

- **Trajectory animations (GIF):** qualitative comparisons across methods, lead times, and OOD settings.
- **High-resolution figures (PNG):** publication-ready visuals for the paper appendix/supplement.

This repository is intentionally **minimal** and focuses on *visual evidence* rather than full training code.
